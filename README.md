> [!IMPORTANT]
> **FBIK (Full-Body IK)**
> <br>Provides an Anim Graph Node that reproduces the behaviour of Control Rig Full Body IK node
> <br>And its **FREE!**

> [!NOTE]
> The Full Body IK node in Control Rig is really good
> <br>Climbing ladders, proning on the ground, mantling all benefit from a good FBIK solution
> <br>However Control Rig can be clunky and take a lot of work to get setup, this allows you to get the same behaviour without any Control Rig
